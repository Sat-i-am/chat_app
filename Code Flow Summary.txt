			Code Flow Summary:

1. Frontend:
   - The frontend of the project is built using **React**. It includes several components for different pages and functionalities, such as `Register`, `Login`, `Chat`, and `SetAvatar`.
   - **React Router** is used for handling navigation between different pages.

2.Authentication:
   - The project implements user authentication with features like registration and login. 
   - When a user registers or logs in, their data (username, email, hashed password) is sent to the backend for validation and storage.

3. Avatar Selection:
   - After a user logs in, they are directed to a page where they can select an avatar as their profile picture. This is done using the `SetAvatar` component.

4. Backend:
   - The backend is built using **Node.js** with **Express.js** as the web application framework.
   - **Mongoose** is used as the ODM (Object-Document Mapper) for MongoDB, which provides a way to interact with the database.

5. Database:
   - The project uses a **MongoDB** database to store user information and messages.
   - There are two schemas defined: one for users and one for messages.

6. User Management:
   - The backend handles user registration and login. It checks if the username and email are unique before creating a new user.
   - Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt** before being stored in the database for security.

7. Real-time Messaging:
   - The project implements real-time messaging using **Socket.IO**. This allows for instant communication between users without the need for constant polling.
   - When a user sends a message, it is emitted to the recipient in real-time.

8. Socket.IO Events:
   - When a new user connects, their socket is stored in a global variable (`chatSocket`). 
   - Users can be added to an online users map, which associates their user ID with their socket ID.
   - Messages are sent from one user to another using their respective socket IDs.

9. Routes:
   - The backend defines several routes for handling user authentication, messages, and avatar setting.

10. Environment Variables:
    - **dotenv** is used to load environment variables, such as the MongoDB URL and server port.

11. Error Handling:
    - The backend includes basic error handling with try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions.

12. Project Structure:
    - The project is organized into files and folders for models, routes, and main server setup.

13. Package Management:
    - **npm** is likely used for managing dependencies and scripts.
